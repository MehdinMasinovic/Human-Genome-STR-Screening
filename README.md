# Short tandem repeat analysis in recombination hotspots across the human genome

This repository serves to store all data relevant to the data analysis that was conducted for my bachelor thesis. It includes all R scripts, figures, and data sets. The folders are fully uploaded. 

Every folder contains the R scripts, data sets, and figures related to one topic. For example, if someone is interested on how STRAH was applied (with what arguments, what repeats, etc.), it is possible to check that in the folder "Applying-STRAH".

Every folder contains a README.md file that shortly describes what files are there and how they can be used to reproduce the results of the thesis. If a R script starts with "git" ("git_\*.R"), it is usually the main file of the folder, meaning that all explanations and applications are explained and described there.  

The R scripts are organized in a way that any user can download the folder, set the working directory into that folder, and run the R commands interactively together with explanation. If the user does not want to run parts of the script and is only interested in g.e. the plotting section, there are all data sets provided.

If there are questions, please don't hesitate to contact me via e-mail (mehdin.masinovic2@gmail.com) or explain your questions in the "Issues" section of this repository.

Yours sincerely, 

Mehdin Masinovic
